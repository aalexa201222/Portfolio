							<h4>Introduction</h4>
							<p>Covid simulation rpoject showcase my Java programming skills and demonstrates my understanding of virus transmission dynamics. The COVID Simulation project
								 is a powerful Java-based program designed to simulate the spread of a virus among individuals within various areas. By providing a visual 
								 representation of virus transmission through personal contact and contact with infected areas, this simulation offers valuable insights 
								 into the dynamics of viral spread and the effectiveness of preventive measures.</p>
							<h4>Overview</h4>
							<p>The COVID Simulation project combines the realms of programming and epidemiology to create a comprehensive and interactive 
								simulation experience. Developed using Java, this program enables users to customize and visualize the spread of a virus 
								across different areas. With the ability to set transmission probabilities and define the number of people, infected individuals,
								 immune individuals, and area dimensions, users can tailor the simulation to specific scenarios and observe the outcome in real-time.</p>
							<h4>Simulation Mechanics</h4>
							<p>TThe simulation operates by generating a virtual environment populated by individuals in various statesâ€”healthy, infected, and immune.
								 These individuals move within the designated areas, interacting with one another and their surroundings. By simulating personal contact
								  and contact with infected areas, the program accurately represents the mechanisms of virus transmission. Users can specify the duration
								   of the simulation, allowing for observation of the progression of the virus over time.</p>
							<h4>Customization and Flexibility</h4>		   
							<p>One of the notable features of the COVID Simulation project is its flexibility and customization options.
								 Users have the ability to fine-tune the simulation parameters according to their requirements. By adjusting 
								 the probabilities of virus transmission and configuring the population size, initial infection rate, immune rate,
								  and area dimensions, users can simulate a wide range of scenarios and study the impact of different variables
								   on the spread of the virus.</p>	 
							<h4>Visual Representation and Analysis</h4>		   
							<p>The simulation provides a captivating visual representation of the spread of the virus, allowing
								 users to observe the interactions between individuals and areas in real-time. At the end of the
								  simulation, a comprehensive report is generated, detailing the final count of healthy, infected, 
								  and immune individuals in each area. This information is invaluable for analyzing the effectiveness of
								   preventive measures and gaining insights into the dynamics of viral spread.</p>
