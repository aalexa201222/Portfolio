							<p>The Warehouse Stock Tracker is a web-based application designed specifically for C.I.M Biomedical, a company specializing in the storage and management of medicines. This system serves as a comprehensive solution for tracking and monitoring the company's inventory, enabling efficient management of stock levels and ensuring the availability of medicines when needed.</p>

							<p>The application features a secure login system that restricts access to authorized personnel only. Employees can log in using their unique username and password, which are authenticated against the company's user database for enhanced security.</p>
							
							<p>Upon logging in, users are presented with the main page, which offers different functionalities based on their roles and permissions. Logistics and Accounting employees have comprehensive access to all features, while warehouse workers have a more limited view focused primarily on product inventory.</p>
								   
							<p>One of the key features of the Warehouse Stock Tracker is the Invoice Search functionality, available to logistics and accounting personnel. This feature allows users to access and view a list of invoices stored in the system's database. Each invoice represents an incoming or outgoing order for the company. Users can search for specific invoices and retrieve detailed information about each, facilitating effective tracking and management of orders.</p>	 
							   
							<p>Another important feature is the Product Search functionality, accessible to all employees. This feature provides a comprehensive list of the company's products stored in the warehouse. Users can search for specific products and view detailed information such as lot numbers, associated invoice numbers, and the exact location within the warehouse. This functionality enables efficient inventory management and ensures accurate tracking of product availability.</p>	 
						
							<p>Overall, the Warehouse Stock Tracker developed for C.I.M Biomedical streamlines the process of managing and monitoring medicine inventory. By providing secure access and intuitive functionalities, the application enables employees to easily navigate and retrieve critical information about invoices and products. The system enhances operational efficiency, ensures accurate inventory control, and contributes to the smooth operation of C.I.M Biomedical's warehouse operations.</p>
